Helmet Detection on Two-wheelers and Penalty Generation using Artificial Intelligence

Abstract
Helmet detection on two-wheelers is a crucial aspect of enforcing safety regulations. Traditional methods of monitoring helmet compliance can be tedious and prone to errors. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, this project aims to automate the enforcement of helmet laws effectively. Through the implementation of YOLOv3-based helmet detection and face recognition technology, the system can proactively identify individuals not wearing helmets and generate penalties. This report outlines the research methodology employed in developing and implementing the helmet detection system.
Introduction
The project focuses on utilizing computer vision techniques to detect helmets on two-wheeler riders and enforce compliance through penalty generation. The integration of YOLOv3 and OpenCV enables real-time detection of helmets in images and videos. Additionally, face recognition technology is employed to identify individuals not wearing helmets, allowing for proactive enforcement of safety regulations.
